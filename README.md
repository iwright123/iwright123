About Me!

Hi, I'm Ian! I'm a software developer from New Orleans with a passion for coding, sports, cooking and gaming. I have a background in agriculture, automotive repair, landscape and software development! 

I usually spend my time surroneded by family when I'm not coding or gaming. On a typical day, most of my time is spent working on various of projects that can range from using M.E.R.N stack to getting my hands drity around the house. What doesn't change is the two daily walks me and my dog take to help relax and get some fresh air! 

Getting into tech has been one of the best decsions I've ever done. Not only has it given me a future to be excited about but it has also shown me the great connections and relationships that I'm grateful for. I graduated from Operation Spark in New Orleans, LA as a Full Stack Web Engineer with a certificate in IBC fundamentals of Javascript, Functional Programming and Web Development Level 3.

I have a deep passion for technology and how it can influence the world. I find myself falling in love everyday with new technologies and how they can help people access the world before them.
